#     # will make everything bigger and allow us to detect more faces.
#     dets = face_detector(img, 1)

#         # distance between them less than 0.6 then they are from the same

#         #  face_descriptor = facerec.compute_face_descriptor(img, shape, 100)
#         # The version of the call without the 100 gets 99.13% accuracy on LFW
#         # while the version with 100 gets 99.38%.  However, the 100 makes the
#         # call 100x slower to execute, so choose whatever version you like.  To
#         # explain a little, the 3rd argument tells the code how many times to
#         # jitter/resample the image.  When you set it to 100 it executes the
#         # face descriptor extraction 100 times on slightly modified versions of
#         # the face and returns the average result.  You could also pick a more
#         # middle value, such as 10, which is only 10x slower but still gets an
#         # LFW accuracy of 99.3%.
